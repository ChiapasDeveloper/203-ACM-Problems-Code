# 203 ACM Problems Source Code in C++

During 2003~2007 I was an undergraduate computer science student. In this time for our course material and for programming passion I used to try and solve ACM problems from the well known University of Valladolid site. I solved arround 203+ ACM problems from this site. Today I found in my laptop still the accepted codes are saved. So I think I should share these code. May be these could be useful for someone.

One thing I want to mention these codes are accepted but not the best optimized code. These codes were written my during my student life so you can't expect that also.

In the code repository file names are the problem number from the University of Valladolid site.
